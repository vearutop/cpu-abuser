# cpu-abuser

CPU abuser burns cycles to keep you warm. ðŸ”¥

## Why?

Some cloud providers (*cough* Oracle *cough*) don't like when machines are idle, they may even think that if running
programs are not CPU-intensive enough machine should be killed with no mercy.

This ridiculous program watches CPU usage and starts spamming CPU with meaningless work once the load in lower than a
threshold.

## Install

```
go install github.com/vearutop/cpu-abuser@latest
$(go env GOPATH)/bin/cpu-abuser --help
```

Or download binary from [releases](https://github.com/vearutop/cpu-abuser/releases).

### Linux AMD64

```
wget https://github.com/vearutop/cpu-abuser/releases/latest/download/linux_amd64.tar.gz && tar xf linux_amd64.tar.gz && rm linux_amd64.tar.gz
./cpu-abuser -version
```

## Usage

```
cpu-abuser -target 20
```

This would start a foreground `cpu-abuser` process that tries to keep CPU usage above 20%.

In practice, you'd want to have it background, for example with `screen`.

```
screen -dmS cpu-abuser ./cpu-abuser -target 18
```

(You can attach later to that screen with `screen -r cpu-abuser` and detach again by )# cpu-abuser
